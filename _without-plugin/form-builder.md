### Introduction

Forms are the most important parts of a websites. They range from simple [contact forms](/contact){: .gray} to forms that handle complete webshop orders or event sign-ups. WordPress has extremely popular form solutions, like 'Contact Form 7' and 'Gravity Forms', but Jekyll does not. To fill this void I created a basic form builder for Jekyll.

### How it works

The form uses Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5. The form can be submitted by CloudCannon, Formspree and FormBucket. The first only works on CloudCannon hosting. You can choose between showing placeholders in the inputs or labels above it. Two special fields are available: a field named 'name' (type 'text') will show 'first name' and 'last name' input boxes on one line. A field named 'address' (type 'text') will show 'address', 'city' and 'postal code' input boxes.

To create a form, add the following code to the front matter of your page:

```
{% raw %}---
form:
  to: xtapo@gmail.com
  subject: New submission!
  redirect: /
  form_engine: formspree
  placeholders: false
  fields:
    - name: name
      input_type: text
      placeholder: Name
      required: true
    - name: email
      input_type: email
      placeholder: Email address
      required: true
    - name: sex
      input_type: radio
      placeholder: male
      required: true
    - name: sex
      input_type: radio
      placeholder: female
      required: true
    - name: message
      input_type: textarea
      placeholder: Message
      required: false
    - name: terms
      input_type: checkbox
      placeholder: I accept the terms and conditions
      required: true
    - name: submit
      input_type: submit
      placeholder: Submit form
      required: true
---{% endraw %}
```

And add this to your layout:

```
{% raw %}{% if page.form %}{% include form.html %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

CloudCannon users should add the available options to their '_config.yml' file to make the experience for content editors even smoother.

```
{% raw %}input_types:
  - text
  - textarea
  - email
  - date
  - checkbox
  - radio
  - number
  - submit

form_engines:
  - cloudcannon
  - formspree
  - formbucket{% endraw %}
```

Disclaimer: Note that there is no select (dropdown) support (yet). Also note that browser support is not perfect. The native HTML5 date picker is not available in every browser and that HMTL5 validation does not work in IE9 and Opera Mini. Use [better forms](/without-plugin/better-forms){: .gray}, if you want HTML5 validation support for all browsers.

### Installation

Step 3. Save the file in the '_includes' directory of your project<br>
Step 4. Add the following line to your layout on the place where you want the form to appear:
