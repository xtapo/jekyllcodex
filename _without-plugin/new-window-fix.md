title: New window fix
---

### Introduction

According to many site owners, PDF documents and external links should open in a new window. Markdown makes it relatively hard to specify this. This script automates this for you, so you do not have to worry about this.

### How it works

This script detects external links and links to PDF files, using plain javascript. It automagically adds 'target="_blank"' to these links. This is done by the following code.
