title: Reading time

### Introduction

The reading time indicator is a simple script which helps to create a reading indicator displaying the estimated reading time for the content. The script calculates the reading time based on a configurable reading speed (180 words per minutes by default).

### How it works

To display the reading time of an article, the code below is used.

```
{% raw %}{% capture words %}
{{ content | number_of_words | minus: 180 }}
{% endcapture %}
{% unless words contains '-' %}
{{ words | plus: 180 | divided_by: 180 | append: ' minutes to read' }}
{% endunless %}{% endraw %}
```
