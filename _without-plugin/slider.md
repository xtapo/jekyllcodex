### Introduction

A lot of websites have a slider. Most of them in the header. Twitter Bootstrap has a slider (carousel) and is often used for creating layouts. The code below also used Twitter Bootstrap (version 3.3.7) and simplifies things by making the default slider fully configurable and editable. Content is stored in the YML of the page. Design decisions are stored in the include variables.

### How it works

The code allows you to set the height of the slider as an integer (number), and the unit in as '%' or 'px'. You can define if you want the transition to be a 'slide' or a 'fade'. And finally how long each slide should stay on the screen (in seconds). An interesting feature, is the option to make the slider responsive. If you set the height to '50' and the unit to '%', the dimensions will always be 2:1, but the height will vary. If you set the height to '300' and the unit to 'px' the height will always be the same, but the dimensions will vary. Note that the CSS in this script replaces the default icons for big HTML arrows and uses background images to ensure that the slider maintains the same height. Click the 'read more' link for a demo.

### Installation

Step 1. Download the file [slider.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtapo/jekyllcodex/gh-pages/_includes/slider.html)
<br />Step 2. Save the file in the '_includes' directory of your project
<br />Step 3. Make sure you load Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.7 and add this to your layout:

```
{% raw %}{% if page.slider %}
  {% include slider.html height="50" unit="%" transition="slide" duration="7" %}
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```
Step 4. Add this YML to the head of your Markdown file:
